<index.html>
<details> <summary>📌 Code Explanation </summary>
This file starts with <!DOCTYPE html>, which tells the browser to use HTML5 for rendering. The <html> tag wraps the entire document and sets the language to English using lang="en".

Inside the <head> section:

<meta charset="UTF-8"> defines the character encoding, allowing special characters and symbols to be displayed correctly.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> ensures the page looks good on mobile by setting width and scale.

<title> sets the title that appears in the browser tab.

<script src="./script.js"> links an external JavaScript file. This script runs when the page loads and adds interactive functionality.

In the <body>, two <h1> headings say “Let’s learn JavaScript”. These appear in large font on the web page. The duplicate heading can be removed if only one is needed.
