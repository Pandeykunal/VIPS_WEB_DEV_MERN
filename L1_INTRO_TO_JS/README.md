<index.html>
This HTML file is a basic structure for introducing JavaScript. It begins with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, which tells the browser to interpret the document using HTML5. The root <html> tag specifies the language as English using the lang="en" attribute. Inside the <head> section, several important elements are defined. The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag ensures that the document uses UTF-8 character encoding, allowing it to support a wide range of characters and symbols. The <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> tag makes the page responsive by adjusting its layout based on the device's screen width and scale. The <title> tag sets the page's title in the browser tab to "Intro to JS".

A <script> tag is used to link an external JavaScript file (script.js) which will be executed when the HTML is loaded. This allows for adding dynamic behavior to the page through JavaScript. In the <body> section, two identical <h1> tags are used to display the heading "Let's learn JavaScript" twice. These headings will appear in large font on the web page. If duplication isnâ€™t intentional, one of them can be removed. Overall, this file serves as a simple starting point for experimenting with JavaScript by linking a script and displaying content on a webpage.
